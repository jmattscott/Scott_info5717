When I came across this website, I was appalled that the majority of the females mention heavy/extra vaginal bleeding.

Although this drug has helped with the pain, it is not worth the cost and hassle of bleeding constantly.,

ARTHROTEC.39.txt2,"none but it wears off after 15 days.
Natural cures are better; apple cidar vinegar can effectively cure arthritis and headaches; vitamin C crystals can help pain at high doses; the Gerson diet with no salt can cure migrains, Fibro etc see doctoryourself.com and 'just say no to drugs' (Nancy Reagan).
"
ARTHROTEC.4.txt5,"I am menstruating with heavy bleeding every 11 days.
Honestly, I can't figure out how I can lose this much blood and still function.
I have horrific cramps to begin with, so I can't say whether arthrotec increased that.
I have endometriosis, so I'm not sure if that is something that doesn't agree with arthrotec.
It did help with the pain I experience with the pinched nerve, but it is not worth it to me to continue.
"
ARTHROTEC.40.txt10,"I have been concerned about long term effects of Arthrotec, but with chronic back for 9 years I cannot live without it right now.
I was shocked to read some of the comments on this website.
I never had any stomach trouble, or cramps, or anything people have mentioned here.
People mentioned Celebrex.
A friend of mine developed an ulcer after only a short time on Celebrex.
I do not have any kind of stomach trouble after 8 years.
Would I rather not take it?
Of course, but I have to be able to get out of the bed in the morning.
I have blood work done every year to see if there's any kidney, liver damage or anything, and so far there hasn't been any.
I would recommend it.
"
ARTHROTEC.41.txt8,"Dizziness, sickness, stomach gas, feel like a bubble of air is stuck in my chest.
Hadn't realised it was related until I read this but I get the hunger pangs too, I'm assuming this is the acids and gas in your stomach constantly churning over that make you feel like you're hungry.
I've taken co-codamol for my fibromyalgia for many years which I have very few side effects with.
I've recently had this severe hip pain on both sides which the co codamol wasn't touching so I went back to the Dr He recommended this anti-inflamatory and as he said next stop would be cortozone injections I was willing to give it a try.
I've tried it for a week but it makes me feel dreadful.
Every time I stand up I have to hold onto something for fear of falling over, I feel sick and light headed and I get those waves of nausea where you suddenly feel all clammy.
It's very much like having a permanent hangover, even down to the hunger which until I read thsi site I hadn't connected to the rest of it.
I've felt no discernible difference in the pain in my hips and the side effects simply aren't worth it so thats it for me and this drug.
"
ARTHROTEC.42.txt16,"Stomach pains, chest pains, anxiety, fatigue, headache, erratic heart beat, raised blood pressure, dizziness, nausea (even when taken with food), blurred vision.
I was given a 6 day trial of Arthrotec along with a 9 day trial of Aciphex on 4/25 (three bottles of three pills).
This was a solution my doctor came up with.
I've never had consistant heart burn or indigestion, no signs of acid reflux, so I was confused as to why he would offer me this medication.
The first day I took both pills, I experienced some dizziness and some nausea and some serious period like cramps.
I was at work, so I just had to brush it off.
It continued each time I took it.
After about two days (two doses), the cramps continued and began inhibiting my menstrual cycle (which I was due to start).
So, I googled the side effects of the drug, came across this site, and realized I wasn't the only one with those side effects, so I felt a little better about it.
On the evening of 4/30, I suddenly got some serious chest pains, an elevated heart rate (I was laying down with my husband and this was similar to an ""I just finished running!"" heart rate), hot flashes, dizziness, sever stomach cramps, and weakness in my legs.
I literally thought I was dying.
It passed within 45 minutes and I was able to go to work the next day.
At work (5/1), I was sitting at my desk and the same thing happened.
I stepped out to get some air but it didn't work.
A friend at work had to call an ambulance.
I was filled in by the ER doc that the mixture of Aciphex and Arthrotec was insane and that he was trying to keep from cracking up at my primary doc's decision to combine them.
"
ARTHROTEC.43.txt5,"Random severe cramping, diarrhea, increased menstrual blood flow.
The day I took my first Arthrotec, I started experiencing urinary incontinence.
It's not severe but enough to be disruptive and require a pad.
I haven't seen this listed in anyone's symptomology.
Has anyone else had this experience?.
"
ARTHROTEC.44.txt2,"This medicine helped with the heel spurs, however the side effects were far worse and not worth taking the medicine.
I had bad gas and SEVERE diarrhea along with stomach cramps and nausea.
"
ARTHROTEC.45.txt6,"Has been all OK until recently when I started to get "" fluey"" feelings in upper arms, legs etc
As I had just recently had flu jab thought this was the cause.
However the symptoms persisted, GP said "" just flu jab"" - but after 4 weeks!
Noticed today after leaving Artrotec off for a day or so ,that things were much better until I took one dose.
fluey feelings returned within a hour.
Draw your own conclusions.
"
ARTHROTEC.46.txt1,"Naseua, vomiting, cramps, dry eyes, loss of appetite.
"
ARTHROTEC.47.txt3,"after taking just one dose, had hunger feeling and stomach cramping, in the eve and through the night constant muscle cramps in my calf muscles, couldn't sleep, had to keep jumping out of bed because of the cramps.
I just went for test and haven't gotten results yet, but Dr feels I have more than 1 form of arthritis, I also have a very sensitive stomach, this is cheaper and more approved by health insurance, so that is why this prescribed.
Seems to me we always have to choose lesser of the 2 evils, I can't deal with Charlie Horses, so I am stopping this med.
"
ARTHROTEC.48.txt5,"I cannot believe the immediate difference this medication had made in my life.
I could not get up from my desk without holding onto the desk and walking up the stairs was intolerable.
Within one day I felt the pain lessen.
I am now walking up the stairs 95 % normal and can actually walk through a mall without having to sit down every 5 minutes.
i am in need of a knee replacement, but in meantime feel like I have my life back.
"
ARTHROTEC.49.txt5,"Took one pill and 20 minutes later had intense pelvic and back pain.
Felt like a miscarriage (I've had 3 of them).
This intense, horrid pain lasted 1.5 hours.
Then I had spotting.
And terrible bloating and nausea.
"
ARTHROTEC.5.txt6,"No side effects.
I tried the advertised Arthritis medicines with severe side-effects and only tried this one because the doctor had samples.
Instead of taking the pill 2X daily, as prescribed I take it at most once per day, usually about 3-4 times per week, but often skipping a week or two at a time.
My arthritis has been under control for years and only causes me trouble if I skip taking the pills for about a month.
At the time this was prescribed the doctor was discussing the strongest possible medicines in serious (threatening) doses.
This drug has been a god-send for me.
"
ARTHROTEC.50.txt10,"no side effects.
Met with surgon last week to schedule hip replacement.
Could not tolerate pain.
Was on hydrocodine heavy aand did not like side effects.
Almost overnight was 100% pain free.
Sorry ladies i don not have bleeding or stomach pains.
Truly wish you could have same results as i have.
Took 5 years ago for shoulder pain and it worked as well.
I am on my feet all day requiring steps and was ready to retire.
I danced at a wedding this weekend for the first time in 3 years.

ARTHROTEC.51.txt1,"severe nausea dizziness terrible stomach pain.
"
ARTHROTEC.52.txt5,"Went to hospital for my Tmj pain because it was getting out of control.
A doctor prescribed me this to take two a day.
One pill and 20 minutes later the worse period cramps in my life.
After half an hour it passed, but its been a day a half now, and i still feel sick after eating and random shooting lower abdominal pains.
I'm scared to death.
"
ARTHROTEC.53.txt1,"From day one of taking this pill I have experienced a significant reduction of pain in both areas and no stiffness in my hands, where before had very little mobility in my right hand, I have however experienced extreme pain/heavy bleeding and dizziness during my period which is not normal for me.

ARTHROTEC.56.txt4,"Took away all my hip pain.
Had very bad cramps diarrhea and heavy bleeding even thought my period wasn't due for 3 more weeks
been off this pill for two days now and still feeling same
hoping cramps stop soon can't stand feeling sick all day.
"
ARTHROTEC.57.txt3,"I have spotting and it had started 2 days after I was taking them
I had stopped taking them for 3 weeks now and still have spotting problems, I talked to doctors and they just shrugged it off.
And then told me go home, I still want to have more children I am at my wits end!!!.
"
ARTHROTEC.58.txt4,"Disorentatation,trouble brathing, extreme hot, redness and swelling, itching, later abominal cramps.
All this came all sudden in couple of minutes.
I had been taking arthrotec before for my knee pain and it helped me a lot.
I only had 10-12 pills left from last March when I had a cortisone shot and my knee pain went away.

My doctor told me the symptoms had to go away after taking few more Second time: I took other 3 pills in 3 days.

I had the first vaginal bleeding, a lot of pruritus and my skin was all red but I didn't know it was arthrotec/

More problems and this time I had the ideo to go on Internet and I discovered I had a lot of the side effects by taking Arthrotec
Why they don't tell you about them?.
"
ARTHROTEC.6.txt7,"It began with stomach pain,then slight nausea, then reflux each time I took a pill.
After the second pill the same progression of symptoms only now the abdominal gas,cramps and pain would be with me all day.
I stopped pills but abdominal cramps persist.
The only good thing I can say about Arthrotec is that I did notice pain relief but I won't put up with the side effects on a daily basis since I spent a long time getting rid of a reflux problem in the past.
The abdominal gas,cramps and discomfort are another thing I don't want to see get worse if I keep taking Arthrotec.
I've taken Tylenol 3 and never had a problem like this.
Perhaps there is something not right yet with Arthrotec.
"
ARTHROTEC.60.txt9,"Took 1 pill with dinner, woke during the night with stomach pain.
In the morning I discovered that I had bled heavily during the night.
Bleeding continued the next day with clotting.
Also developed a rash on my wrist.
Discontinued use after one pill!!.
After checking the web site and seeing the list of side effects for this medication, it is hard to believe that it was ever approved.
I do not recommend this medication for anyone.
I have never had a reaction to any medication before.
The complications of this drug outweight the benefits.
"
ARTHROTEC.61.txt5,"Very little side effects,some gas.
Gave me my life back.

"
ARTHROTEC.67.txt5,"W/ prescribed dosage (75 mg BID) crankiness and irritability.
Increased BP.
Possible visual disturbances.
Relieved pain very well.
However, the side effects are a great concern.
"
ARTHROTEC.68.txt7,"For the first 8 days of ever taking it, the only side effect was a similar feeling you get when you have an empty stomach and light nausea that lasted for no more that 30 minutes
After 8 days, the feeling elevated to an annoying sharp pain in my stomach.
Then two days later, I had to stop using it because the pain was becoming unbearable.
Now I have been off for two days and I still have the stomach pain.
Aside from the stomach pain, it worked miracle on my nighttime spinal pain.
Now I have to see my doctor again to see if I should keep taking it.
I tried Naprosyn just before and had to stop taking it for the same reasons.
"
ARTHROTEC.69.txt3,"Some gas & diarrhea but overall OK if taken with food.
Tried other anti-inflammatories but this is the one that works best for me.
Helps me walk & carry on a normal lifestyle because it eases the pain a lot.

ARTHROTEC.7.txt6,"started having a severe sudden onset headache in the back of head, resulted in trip to DR, BP was extrememly high, and pulse was high as well, after three shots, and 3 clonidine to bring down bp was recommend to visit ER.
Had high BP for another 10 days, before it came back down to normal, and pulse is still extremely high 3 weeks after stopping the medicine.
I only took for 7 days, and it caused this much problems.
Never again, I would not recommend this to use.
I have had 2 trips back to dr, since this happened and a third visit due to the tachycardia is schedule in 3 more days.
I will not use anymore.
"
ARTHROTEC.70.txt11,"severe acid reflux after taking for 15 days.
I am back on it now for 1 month after making adjustment to my diet.
Helps very much.
I would get about a 30 sec.
headache but no longer.
AS I have had a history of running to the toilet I dont do that any longer.
Happy response.
Since I cant take most of the other meds.
I was hoping this one would do the job.
It is helping more than I could have wished for.
If you email me, make sure you put the subject in or I wont answer.

Cold sweat, fainting, heart palpitations.

Works but can realy tell how good it works when I had to go off of it.
"
ARTHROTEC.73.txt3,"I've been post-menopausal for five years and have now had a six day period with all the accompanying tender breasts, bloating, cramping etc
I had only been taking on an ""as needed"" basis so one or two a day approx.
every 3 to 4 weeks.
"
ARTHROTEC.74.txt4,"Slight Gasto discomfort, but usually take NEXIUM so discomfort is tolerable.
I take ARTHROTEC 50 every day, sometimes BID and have found nothing that works better.
Now I am running out, am un-insured and can't afford the medication.
Will probably go back to IB 800 mg BID.

ARTHROTEC.75.txt4,"Vaginal bleeding when it was not time for my period, headaches, neck pain,bloating and weight gain.
It helped relieve the pain in my lower back but I would not recommend this to be used by women of any age.
Not quite sure what I will do now because I cannot take Bextra or Neurontin.
I guess go back to plain old advil and deal with it unless the doctor has another medication I can try.
"
ARTHROTEC.76.txt6,"swelling, bloating, increased appetite, empty stomach feeling,dry,itchy skin.
Arthrotec works wonders, but side effects worry me.
Am trying to wean off it with glucoasamine/chondroitin and MSM, which are supposed to be good for arthritis, bone enhancement/elasticity etc
Taking all at same time now,pain is too great!
Was on IB 1600 a day and 2 tylenol 8's a day.
not enough.

I will never take it again.

ARTHROTEC.79.txt10,"Nothing unusual or that Im aware of .
I have some acid reflux thats developed over the last few years, which may not be related since it runs in the family.
Works great!
Hard to function without (pain),when I ran out.
Im probably addicted to it.
Somewhat concerned about the long term effects and listed possible side effects, so I've only ever taken arthrotec 50 once daily rather than twice, which is just enough to manage my pain levels.
I feel it has a cummulative effect.
maybe.
I dont think anything will completely remove the pain, and maybe shouldnt since it helps you to know whats going on.
Else how much would you have to take, thus increasing your risk for possible adverse reactions.
"
ARTHROTEC.8.txt4,"No side effect to begin, but now starting to upset my stomach even while taking with food and plenty of water.
Didn't work for me.

ARTHROTEC.80.txt5,"abdominal pain, constant soreness in abdomen, headache, general stomach upset feeling that won't go away before or after eating.

I was taking Celebrex until ineffective, then Vioxx, then Lodine, and now Arthrotec.

take it once a day and it works very well on the pain.
"
ARTHROTEC.82.txt4,"I had diarrhea, severe abdominal pain which was constant for 4 hours straight, vomiting, trembling, dizziness, nausea.
Arthrotec seemed to induce my menstrual cramps and cause the pain to be severe.
I would not recommend this drug to anyone, especially since I have never had such an adverse reaction to any other medication.
Also, I would caution women not to take this medication while menstruating, since one side effect can be severe menstual pain.
"
ARTHROTEC.83.txt1,"I developed severe abdominal pains, severe welts all over my legs from feet up to knees, swelling of throat, rapid heart beat and headaches.

how did this ever pass scrutiny of the powers that be.
Crazy side effects.
Dizziness while rolling over while sleeping and faintness and disorientation upon sitting up in the morning.
Major stomach pain, massive gas cramps and bloating.
Could not stop going to the bathroom with the runs.
Thought I was having a heart attack or stroke coming on.
Only took it for 5 days with only one a day in the morning with food.
Could not figure out why I was so sick.
Thanks to this site.
Stopping it pronto!
Needs to be banned.
Warnings should be discussed with pharmacist face to face when this is prescribed and before taking it.
Should be scrutinized from the first pill.

ARTHROTEC.86.txt5,"This medicine completely relieves my thumb pain, and really helps with my back pain.
BUT, it makes my stomach hurt soooo bad that I'm not sure what is worse.
I only use it when my thumbs hurt so bad I want to cry.

It also give you diarrhea but I can handle that.

ARTHROTEC.89.txt3,"The day after I started taking it, I had a little vaginal bleeding in spite of being menopausal for 10 years.
I had been using Estrace for several months but had not had bleeding from the Estrace alone.
My back does feel better, not 100% OK, but probably 60%.

ARTHROTEC.9.txt5,"vomitting - I have to fight to not throw up I am supposed to take this twice a day - but it makes me soooooo sick that I take literally as I a going to bed, so that I am asleep before the sickness kicks in.
I have tried and tried to take the day dose - but I would rather live without the sickness - its just too awful.
very painful joints - but with this tablet, the pain is much much reduced.
If I miss a couple of days I really know about it.
If I could find the same sort of thing without the EXTREME nausea - I would switch drugs in teh blink of an eye.

ARTHROTEC.90.txt5,"The pill eliminated all pain I felt in my hip, but it was hard on my stomach.
On my 10th day of medication, I experienced vaginal bleeding.
This scared me because it was two weeks after my normal period.
There is something really fishy about this drug.
I do not advise anyone to take it as there are many adverse side effects.

ARTHROTEC.91.txt2,"No side effects, but I always add acidophilous to my diet with any anti-inflammatories or antibiotics.

If I miss a day, headaches begin to creep in.
Tried many others, this seemed to work best for quite some time.
No day is pain free, though.
Not bad on stomach - always take w/ milk or food.
This is genetic for me, so NSAIDs will be in my life for a while.
but fear long-term use of this one.

ARTHROTEC.94.txt4,"Experienced excruciating, unusual abdominal pain (bowel, uterine) and lower back pain for about 5 hours after taking (including diarrhea 6 times), and heart palpitations and vaginal bleeding for about a day after taking.
I took with 2 aspirin (which I've since learned is contraindicated) and some fruit.
This may be the reason for problems in my case.
I will not take it again as the pain was extreme, but others should be cautious to take with lots of food and no aspirin.

I was told to stop taking Arthrotec and am now using a natural product that seems to work it is called Pernamax.
"
ARTHROTEC.96.txt9,"For the first week I took one pill at bedtime, but then switched to mornings with breakfast.
I experienced extreme uterine cramping within 30 minutes of taking in the morning; I was in excruciating pain for an hour so I called an ambulance and was rushed to the emergency room.
Heavy bleeding started within 30 minutes after the cramping ceased.
Medical personnel dismissed the symptoms as not being related to taking this drug, but once I stopped taking, my cramping and bleeding stopped.
Subsequent uterine & vaginal ultrasounds did not show anything else to be the cause.
My OB/Gyn told me that she uses misoprostal (1 of the drugs in Arthrotec) for miscarriages & advised me to stop taking the drug.
I would not recommend to females.
If you do take this drug, please pay careful attention to your body and other symptoms that may appear.
Read all drug material carefully.

ARTHROTEC.97.txt5,"The symptoms got progressively worse with time.
They included fluid retention, all over muscle pain, cramps.
I stopped taking them a week ago and felt much better the next day.

ARTHROTEC.99.txt6,"If I take the pill on an empty stomach I get a very faint sensation of queasiness .
almost to faint to notice.
However, I also get diarrhoea at least twice a day.
There are no gas pains and no other symptoms, so it's inconvenient more than anything else.
When I am on holiday at the coast I am pain free, mostly, so don't take any Arthrotec, but when I get back to a drier climate the pain is severe, so Arthrotec is very important to me and my quality of life.
It also allows me to sleep.
